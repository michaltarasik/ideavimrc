# General Information
This is my personal PhpStorm configuration file for IdeaVim.

# Installation
1. Create symlink to `~/.ideavimrc` from file `ideavimrc` and edit `ideavimrc` file to show specific path to files

Example
```bash
ln -s ideavimrc/ideavimrc $HOME/.ideavimrc

```
2. Set keymap in settings like in `PhpStormActions` file

# Make sure you have the following plugins installed:
